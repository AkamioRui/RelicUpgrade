This program shows which a relic should be discarded and which should be upgraded.


requirement:
the only requirement is to be able to host an HTTP server. This can be done via:
1. python: (8000 is arbitrary, any port doesnt matter)
    python3 -m http.server 8000 
2. using vscode live server plugin 
3. PHP: php -S localhost:8000
etc


While the program just need the relicUpgrade.exe and the html/css/js stuff, I still included the full source code.
