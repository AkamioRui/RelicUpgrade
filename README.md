This program shows which a relic should be discarded and which should be upgraded.


installation:
1. git clone or download the zip file from the release branch
2. open relicUpgradeGUI.html, this program can then be used immediately 


sidenote:
While the program just need the relicUpgrade.exe and the html/css/js stuff, I still included the full source code.
